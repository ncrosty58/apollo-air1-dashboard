"""Home + Away location -- the single source of truth for which place the
dashboard tracks.

- **Home** drives Node-RED's polling and is logged to InfluxDB. When it changes
  the app pushes the home record to Node-RED over a *retained* MQTT config topic
  (see mqtt_bridge.publish_config); Node-RED reads coords/zip/sensor from it and
  tags every `outside_air_quality` write with the home `location_slug`. Coords
  and tag therefore always change together, from this one record.
- **Away** is a live, unpersisted read-through the app renders from provider
  historical APIs (see away.py). Its selection is stored here so the view
  survives a refresh, but it is *never* published to Node-RED and never logged.

Stored as one JSON file on the shared data volume, same read-modify-write +
atomic-replace pattern as locations.py."""
