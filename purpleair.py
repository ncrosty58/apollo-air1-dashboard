"""PurpleAir provider -- hyperlocal PM readings from the nearest outdoor
community sensor. Unlike AirNow/Google there's no regional model here: it's
one physical sensor, so readings are minutes fresh but PM-only (no gases).

Node-RED polls one hardcoded sensor every 10 minutes and writes corrected
PM2.5/PM10 + a recomputed AQI to InfluxDB (see the "Format PurpleAir Fields
& Tags" function in the Apollo AIR-1 flow) -- this module just reads that
back, same pattern as owm.py. The dashboard itself never calls PurpleAir.
Raw cf_1 PM2.5 is corrected there with EPA's Barkjohn equation (the same
one AirNow's own Fire & Smoke map applies to PurpleAir sensors) before
converting to an AQI, so this provider's number is comparable to AirNow's
rather than reading systematically high."""
